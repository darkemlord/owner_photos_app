# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

User.create(user_id: 'emanuel', password: 'emanuel123')

# user.images.attach(io: File.open("app/assets/images/background_blog.jpeg"), filename: "emanuel_rock.jpeg")
